# Car Selling App

Welcome to the Car Selling App project! This application is designed to facilitate the buying and selling of cars. The frontend of the app is built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, providing a smooth and responsive user interface. Below, you'll find information on the features, technologies used, and instructions on setting up the project.

In the backend, I use a Node.js API for authentication and to process queries. It is deployed on the Render website.
